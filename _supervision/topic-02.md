### Outline.
<p align="justify"> Shock instruments or proxies are designed to isolate the effects on the macroeconomy of a specific structural shock of interest. This instrument/proxy should be highly correlated with the specific shock but be truly exogenous to other factors and structural shocks. The macroeconomic literature generally agrees on how to effectively measure monetary policy surprises, extreme weather, or climate shocks in an exogenous manner by assessing the high frequency responsiveness of financial markets (interest rates at different maturities, prices on future markets, stock returns, exchange rates, etc.) around policy announcements or significant events/phenomena. A dissertation related to this topic could focus on designing/finding a novel and innovative instrument to identify a particular structural shock of interest (e.g., extreme weather or climate shocks) and analyze its features using an event study. Alternatively, one could critically discuss established instruments (or identification schemes in general) used in the macroeconomic literature.
