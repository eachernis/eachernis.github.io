### Outline.
<p align="justify"> In light of the recent surge in inflation, central banks around the globe have raised interest rates and pursued contractionary monetary policies. One unconventional tool used to tighten the money and credit supply to the economy is quantitative tightening (QT), which is the exact opposite of quantitative easing (QE). With QT central banks aim to shrink their balance sheets, which are still inflated by financial assets with longer maturities purchased during the period of the effective lower bound. While central banks were constrained by the zero lower bound when using QE, there is no such constraint for QT. This may indicate that QT and QE measures have asymmetric effects on the macroeconomy. That is, the macroeconomic effects of QT measures (or balance sheet tightening) may not offset the effects of QE measures (or balance sheet easing) in a symmetric (one-to-one) manner. To address this research question, a dissertation could rely on well-established monetary policy instruments to measure exogenous movements in (long-term) interest rates associated with QT and QE measures. The dissertation could use descriptive statistics, conduct an event study, or employ local projections. The story of QE and QT just serves as an illustrative example for asymmetric effects. A dissertation could also focus on other structural economic shocks (e.g., oil price shocks).
