### Outline.
<p align="justify"> Accurate measurement of long-run trends in real interest rates and identifying the key drivers behind them is of great interest for central banks. The equilibrium real interest rate is the rate at which an economy operates at its potential output level while inflation remains stable. Over the past thirty years, we have seen a downward trend in real interest rates, but this trend has recently come to an abrupt stop. Climate change, transition to a greener economy, rising inflation, increased inflation volatility, and secular stagnation pose significant challenges to central banks in accurately measuring the equilibrium real interest rate (and thus in effectively assessing their monetary policy stance). A dissertation could critically evaluate different approaches to measuring the equilibrium real interest rate or provide new insights by combining historical macroeconomic data with data on climate change.
