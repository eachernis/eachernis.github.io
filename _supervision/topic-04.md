### Outline.
<p align="justify"> Policy makers in central banks often use disaggregate components to model or forecast an aggregate, such as headline consumer price inflation. Due to the availability of increasingly granular data, machine learning techniques and approaches that can handle big data have gained popularity in this literature. A dissertation could provide a helicopter tour on the pros and cons of machine learning techniques for forecasting and modeling inflation using big data (compared to simpler econometric tools). Monetary policy authorities are also highly interested in modeling the relationship between unemployment and inflation, known as the Phillips curve relationship. This relationship may still be "alive" for certain regions/countries but "dead" for others. A dissertation could break down aggregate inflation measures by different regions or subcomponents and critically assess their drivers. Alternatively, one could examine regional differences in the Phillips curve coefficient and assess how this relationship differs across regions.
