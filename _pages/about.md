I am a Principal Economist at the [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/tony-chernis/) and a PhD Student (expected graduation 2024/25) at the University of Strathclyde. 
My dissertation focuses on developing novel techniques to use multiple models for macro-economic forecasting and decisionmaking. My recent work shows how to make [monetary policy decisions using multiple models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03321) and how to combine forecasts using [Bayesian machine learning methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12671). My work has been published in the *International Journal of Forecasting*, the *Journal of Applied Econometrics*, and *Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics & Econometrics*, among others.

My policy work focuses on topics of interest to the conduct of monetary policy, forecasting, model combination, and survey development. Notably, I developed nowcasting models for the Bank of Canada ([here](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/05/staff-discussion-paper-2022-12/), [here](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/08/staff-discussion-paper-2018-9/) and [here](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2017/06/staff-discussion-paper-2017-8/)) and created a new [Business Survey](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/06/staff-discussion-paper-2022-14/).
