I am an Assistant Director for Macroeconomics at the Bermuda Monetary Authority. I work primarily on Financial Stability and Macroeconomic issues for Bermuda. 
 
My research focuses on developing novel techniques for using multiple models in macro-economic forecasting and decisionmaking. My recent work shows how to make [monetary policy decisions using multiple models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03321) and how to combine forecasts using [Bayesian machine learning methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12671). An sub-theme in my work is using [machine learning techniques in econometric models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04928). My work has been published in the *International Economic Review*, the *International Journal of Forecasting*, the *Journal of Applied Econometrics*, and *Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics & Econometrics*, among others.

My current policy work focuses on financial stability and macroeconomic issues in Bermuda. Previously, I worked on tools related to the conduct of monetary policy, forecasting, model combination, and survey development. Notably, I developed nowcasting models for the Bank of Canada ([here](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/05/staff-discussion-paper-2022-12/), [here](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/08/staff-discussion-paper-2018-9/) and [here](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2017/06/staff-discussion-paper-2017-8/)) and created a new [Business Survey](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2022/06/staff-discussion-paper-2022-14/).
